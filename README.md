# py-distance-transforms
`py_distance_transforms` is a Python package that provides efficient distance transform operations on arrays. It is a wrapper around the Julia package [DistanceTransforms.jl](https://github.com/Dale-Black/DistanceTransforms.jl), bringing its high-performance capabilities to the Python ecosystem.

## Features

- Fast distance transform computations on CPU and GPU
- Support for 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Multi-threading for enhanced CPU performance
- GPU acceleration for NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA)
- Simple and intuitive API

## Installation

Install `py_distance_transforms` using pip:

```bash
pip install py_distance_transforms
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from py_distance_transforms import transform
import numpy as np

arr = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(10, 10)).astype(np.float32)
result = transform(arr)
```

## GPU Acceleration

```python
import torch
from py_distance_transforms import transform_cuda

x_gpu = torch.rand((100, 100), device='cuda')
x_gpu = (x_gpu > 0.5).float()

gpu_transformed = transform_cuda(x_gpu)
```
